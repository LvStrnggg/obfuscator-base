# Obfuscator/Deobfuscator Base

I made this base as per request from a fellow friend. The base is very easy to use and shouldn't take too long to understand how it works. If you're still confused after looking at the few classes included in the base, I've added an example transformer, which changes an int push operation into a LDC (don't actually use this, this isn't good, nor does it provide any security or any actual benefit).

# How to build?
 - Open the directory in IntelliJ or Eclipse and build it... duh.

# What are the in.jar and out.jar files?
These are added in the project as a sample, which you can test your transformers on.
